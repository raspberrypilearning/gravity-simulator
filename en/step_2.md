<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Sir Isaac Newton**</span> described gravity in 1666 at a time when laws of nature were unknown. It is rumoured that stumbled upon the notion of gravity when he watched an apple fall from a tree. The apple fell straight to the ground instead of moving sideways or floating away.
