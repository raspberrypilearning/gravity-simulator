## Create your backdrop

In space it feels like everything is floating, but on Earth everything and everybody is pulled down towards the ground. 

You will set up your project with the **Stars** backdrop and a piece of land pulling the **Dot** sprite towards it.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Sir Isaac Newton**</span> described gravity in 1666 at a time when the laws of nature were unknown. It is rumoured that he stumbled upon the notion of gravity when he watched an apple fall from a tree. The apple fell straight to the ground instead of moving sideways or floating away.
