## Simulate the effects of gravity on Mooncake

In space, it feels like everything is floating. This is because everything becomes **weightless** outside of our planet, Earth. This is probably the biggest difference from being on Earth, where everything and everybody is pulled down towards the ground. On Earth, we can all feel this downward pull, but we are so used to it that we sometimes do not even think about it. This pull or attraction we feel is called **gravity**.

To this day, no one really knows what gravity “is”. But we do know how gravity works. Every piece of matter in the universe attracts every other piece of matter. The more matter there is, the stronger the attraction, but the attraction decreases when the distance between the pieces of matter increases. For this reason, the planets, which have much less mass than the Sun, orbit the Sun, and the Moon orbits the Earth. Because we walk on the surface of a huge lump of matter, the Earth, these basic facts are not at all obvious.

Sir Isaac Newton is rumoured to have stumbled upon this notion of gravity when he watched an apple fall from a tree.

You can recreate the effects of the force of gravity on Earth in this Scratch simulation!
