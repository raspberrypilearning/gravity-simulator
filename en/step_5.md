## Create variables to store data

- To create a variable, click on `Variables` in the blocks palette and then click `Make a Variable`. The New Variable window opens and asks you to type a name for your variable.

- Name the first variable `gravity` and ensure that `For all sprites` is checked before clicking **OK**.
	A variable holds a value that can be changed, and can be used elsewhere in your program.

- You'll see some orange blocks are added to your `Variables` area called `gravity`, and a small counter box will appear on the stage.

- You need to make another variable in the same way as before, called `velocity`.
