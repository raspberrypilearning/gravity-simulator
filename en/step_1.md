## Introduction

Create a simulator in Scratch to show the real-life effects of gravity on different planets in our solar system. 

You will:

- Learn about the force of gravity and how it is calculated.
- Add and edit a **sprite** and a **backdrop** to set up your project.
- Create `variables`{:class="block3variables"} to store data.
- Use an `if`{:class="block3control"} condition to control your project.
- Insert `multiply operators`{:class="block3operators"} to calculate values.

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1">  
Click space bar to jump. Use number keys 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 to see the gravity simulation for different planets. 

On which planet is Dot's jump the smallest?
