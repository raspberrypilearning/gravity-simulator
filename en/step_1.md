## What you will make
In this activity, you will learn about the effects of gravity and how to simulate them in Scratch with code and the Raspberry Pi Foundation's cat Mooncake. 

You can learn more about the forces of gravity and the effects of weightlessness as well as more about British ESA Astronaut Tim Peake's mission aboard the International Space Station on [the UK National STEM Centre website here](http://www.nationalstemcentre.org.uk/timpeake).

## What you will learn
By creating a gravity simulator in Scratch, you will learn:

- Learn about the force of gravity and how it is calculated.
- Add an `if`{:class="block3control"} block to detect and respond to `touching colour`{:class="block3sensing"}.
- Use `multiply`{:class="block3operators"} operators to calculate values and store numbers in `variables`{:class="block3variables"}.
