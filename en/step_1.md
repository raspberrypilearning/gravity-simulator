## Introduction

Create a simulator in Scratch to show the real-life effects of gravity on different planets. 

You will:

- Learn about the force of gravity and how it is calculated.
- Add an `if`{:class="block3control"} block to detect and respond to `touching colour`{:class="block3sensing"}.
- Use `multiply`{:class="block3operators"} operators to calculate values and store numbers in `variables`{:class="block3variables"}.

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1">  
Use number keys 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 to set the gravity simulation for different planets. 

Click the space bar to jump. On which planet is the **Dot** sprite's jump the smallest?
